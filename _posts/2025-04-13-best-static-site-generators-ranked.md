# Best Static Site Generators Ranked (Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy…)

In the ever-evolving world of web development, static site generators (SSGs) have emerged as powerful tools that combine the performance benefits of static sites with the flexibility of content management systems. This comprehensive guide ranks the top static site generators of 2025, helping you find the perfect tool for your next project.

## What Makes a Great Static Site Generator?

Before diving into specific tools, let's establish our criteria for evaluation:

1. **Build Speed**: How quickly the generator processes content into a deployable site
2. **Learning Curve**: Ease of adoption for new developers
3. **Ecosystem**: Available plugins, themes, and community support
4. **Flexibility**: Customization options and integration capabilities
5. **Documentation**: Quality and comprehensiveness of official guides
6. **Performance**: Runtime efficiency of generated sites

## 1. Hugo: The Speed Champion

**Overall Score: 9.5/10**

Hugo continues to dominate the SSG landscape in 2025, primarily due to its unmatched build speed. Written in Go, Hugo can generate thousands of pages in milliseconds.

### Key Strengths:
- **Lightning-fast builds**: Regenerates sites 10-100x faster than most competitors
- **Zero dependencies**: Single binary installation
- **Mature ecosystem**: Extensive theme marketplace and plugin architecture
- **Multilingual support**: Built-in internationalization
- **Flexible content model**: Supports taxonomies, sections, and custom content types

### Potential Drawbacks:
- Go templating syntax has a moderate learning curve
- Advanced customizations may require Go knowledge

### Ideal For:
- Large documentation sites
- Media-rich blogs with frequent updates
- Enterprise applications requiring rapid deployment

```bash
# Quick start with Hugo
hugo new site mysite
cd mysite
git init
git submodule add https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke themes/ananke
echo "theme = 'ananke'" >> config.toml
hugo server -D
```

## 2. Next.js: The React Powerhouse

**Overall Score: 9.3/10**

While technically a React framework, Next.js has evolved into an exceptional static site generator with its enhanced static export capabilities.

### Key Strengths:
- **React ecosystem**: Leverages the vast React component ecosystem
- **Hybrid rendering**: Static generation, server-side rendering, and incremental static regeneration

- Steeper learning curve for non-React developers

### Ideal For:
- React developers building content-heavy applications
- Sites requiring dynamic features with static foundations
- JAMstack applications with API integrations

```javascript
// Simple Next.js static page
export default function HomePage() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my statically generated site</h1>
      <p>Built with Next.js static export</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 3. Astro: The Performance Innovator
