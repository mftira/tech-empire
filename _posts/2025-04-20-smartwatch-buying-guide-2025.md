## FAQs

**Q: Do I need cellular connectivity in my smartwatch?**
A: If you frequently exercise without your phone or want the ability to make calls independently, cellular connectivity is worth the extra cost. However, be aware that it requires a separate data plan with your carrier.

**Q: How accurate are the health metrics on smartwatches?**
A: The accuracy has improved significantly, with many watches now FDA-cleared for certain measurements. However, consumer devices should not replace medical equipment for those with serious health conditions.

**Q: What's the difference between AMOLED and Micro-LED displays?**
A: AMOLED offers deep blacks and vibrant colors but can suffer from burn-in over time. Micro-LED provides similar benefits with better brightness, efficiency, and longevity, but typically at a higher cost.
