## How These Phones Compare to Flagships

What are you giving up by choosing one of these budget options instead of a $1000+ flagship?

**Areas where flagships still lead:**
- **Camera systems**: While budget phones have capable cameras, flagships still offer better sensors, more versatile lens arrangements, and more sophisticated computational photography.
- **Display technology**: Flagships typically offer higher brightness, higher resolution, and more advanced features like LTPO displays with variable refresh rates from 1-120Hz.
- **Processing power**: For the most demanding tasks like 8K video editing or emulation, flagship processors still maintain an edge.
- **Build materials**: Flagships tend to use more premium materials like titanium frames or ceramic backs.
- **Cutting-edge features**: New technologies typically debut in flagships before trickling down to budget models.

**Areas where the gap has closed:**
- **Day-to-day performance**: For most applications, including social media, productivity, and even gaming, budget phones now perform nearly identically to flagships.
- **Battery life**: Many budget phones actually outlast their flagship counterparts, partly due to slightly thicker designs accommodating larger batteries.
- **Display quality**: High refresh rate AMOLED displays are now standard even on budget devices.
- **Software experience**: Budget phones now receive longer software support, closing one of the biggest historical gaps.
