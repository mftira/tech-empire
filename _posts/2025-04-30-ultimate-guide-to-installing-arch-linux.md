# Ultimate Guide to Installing Arch Linux (2025 Edition)

Everything you need to know to install Arch Linux successfully in 2025.

## Introduction

Arch Linux remains one of the most respected distributions among Linux enthusiasts for good reason. Its "keep it simple" philosophy, rolling release model, and minimalist approach give users complete control over their system. While Arch's installation process has evolved over the years, it still requires more manual intervention than most distributionsâ€”and that's by design.

This guide covers the complete installation process for Arch Linux in 2025, including the latest tools and best practices. Whether you're a first-time Arch user or returning for a fresh installation, we'll walk through every step to ensure success.

## Why Choose Arch Linux in 2025?

Before diving into installation, let's consider why Arch might be the right choice for you:

- **Complete customization**: Build your system from the ground up with only what you need
- **Rolling release model**: Get the latest software updates without major version upgrades
- **Exceptional documentation**: The [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) remains the gold standard for Linux documentation
- **Active community**: A knowledgeable and helpful community in forums and IRC/Discord
- **Pacman package manager**: Fast, powerful, and straightforward package management
- **AUR (Arch User Repository)**: Access to thousands of community-maintained packages

The installation process itself serves as an excellent learning opportunity about how Linux systems work underneath the hood.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- A computer with at least 2GB RAM (4GB+ recommended for desktop environments)
- At least 20GB free disk space (more recommended for practical use)
- Internet connection (wired is easier for installation)
- USB drive (4GB+) for the installation media
- Basic familiarity with command line operations
- 1-2 hours of uninterrupted time
- Patience and willingness to learn

## Preparation

### 1. Download the ISO

Download the latest Arch Linux ISO from the [official download page](https://archlinux.org/download/). As of 2025, the ISO includes several quality-of-life improvements like the `archinstall` script, though we'll cover both guided and manual installation methods.

### 2. Create a Bootable USB Drive

#### On Linux:
```bash
# Replace /dev/sdX with your USB device (be careful to get this right!)
sudo dd bs=4M if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/sdX status=progress oflag=sync
```

#### On Windows:
Use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/), [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), or [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/) to write the ISO to your USB drive.

#### On macOS:
```bash
# Replace diskN with your USB device
sudo dd if=/path/to/archlinux.iso of=/dev/diskN bs=4m
```

### 3. Boot from USB

1. Insert your USB drive and restart your computer
2. Enter your BIOS/UEFI settings (usually by pressing F2, F12, Del, or Esc during boot)
3. Set your USB drive as the first boot device
4. Save changes and exit

## Quick Installation with Archinstall (The Easy Way)

Since 2021, Arch Linux has included the `archinstall` script which automates much of the installation process. In 2025, this tool has matured significantly and offers an excellent way to get started.

1. Boot from the Arch ISO and select "Arch Linux install medium"
2. Once at the prompt, verify your internet connection:
   ```bash
   ping -c 3 archlinux.org
   ```
3. Run the guided installer:
   ```bash
   archinstall
   ```

4. Follow the interactive prompts to configure your installation:
   - Select your language and location
   - Choose a disk layout (the automatic partitioning works well for most users)
   - Select a desktop environment (or none for a minimal installation)
   - Set your username, password, and hostname
   - Choose additional packages to install

5. Review your selections and proceed with the installation
6. When finished, reboot into your new system

While `archinstall` is convenient, many Arch users prefer the manual installation for complete control and learning purposes. Let's cover that next.

## Manual Installation (The Arch Way)

### 1. Boot into the Live Environment

Once booted from the USB, you'll see the Arch Linux boot menu. Select "Arch Linux install medium" and press Enter.

### 2. Set Console Keyboard Layout (if needed)

The default layout is US. If you use a different keyboard layout:
```bash
# List available layouts
ls /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/**/*.map.gz

# Load your preferred layout (e.g., UK)
loadkeys uk
```

### 3. Verify Boot Mode

Check if your system uses UEFI or BIOS:
```bash
ls /sys/firmware/efi/efivars
```
If the command shows files, you're in UEFI mode. If it shows an error, you're in BIOS mode.

### 4. Connect to the Internet

For wired connections, the live environment should connect automatically. Verify with:
```bash
ping -c 3 archlinux.org
```

For Wi-Fi, use `iwctl`:
```bash
iwctl
device list
station wlan0 scan
station wlan0 get-networks
station wlan0 connect SSID
# Enter password when prompted
exit
```

### 5. Update System Clock

```bash
timedatectl set-ntp true
```

### 6. Partition the Disks

First, identify your target disk:
```bash
lsblk
```

Use `fdisk` or `gdisk` (for GPT) or `cfdisk` (easier TUI):
```bash
cfdisk /dev/nvme0n1  # Replace with your disk
```

#### For UEFI systems:
1. Create a 512 MB EFI System Partition (ESP)
2. Create a swap partition (optional, recommended size = RAM size up to 16GB)
3. Create a root partition with the remaining space (you can also create separate home partition)

#### For BIOS systems:
1. Create a 1MB BIOS boot partition (type 4)
2. Create a swap partition
3. Create a root partition

### 7. Format the Partitions

Format the EFI partition (UEFI only):
```bash
mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/nvme0n1p1
```

Format swap partition (if created):
```bash
mkswap /dev/nvme0n1p2
swapon /dev/nvme0n1p2
```

Format root partition:
```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p3
```

Format home partition (if separate):
```bash
mkfs.ext4 /dev/nvme0n1p4
```

### 8. Mount the File Systems

```bash
mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt
```

Create and mount the EFI directory (UEFI only):
```bash
mkdir -p /mnt/boot/efi
mount /dev/nvme0n1p1 /mnt/boot/efi
```

Mount home partition (if separate):
```bash
mkdir /mnt/home
mount /dev/nvme0n1p4 /mnt/home
```

### 9. Install Base System

The `pacstrap` tool installs the base system:
```bash
pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware intel-ucode # or amd-ucode
```

Also install essential tools:
```bash
pacstrap /mnt base-devel vim nano git networkmanager
```

### 10. Generate Fstab

```bash
genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab
```

### 11. Chroot into the New System

```bash
arch-chroot /mnt
```

### 12. Set Time Zone and Localization

```bash
ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Region/City /etc/localtime
hwclock --systohc
```

Edit `/etc/locale.gen` and uncomment your locale (e.g., `en_US.UTF-8`):
```bash
nano /etc/locale.gen
```

Generate locales:
```bash
locale-gen
```

Create `/etc/locale.conf`:
```bash
echo "LANG=en_US.UTF-8" > /etc/locale.conf
```

Set keyboard layout (if different):
```bash
echo "KEYMAP=uk" > /etc/vconsole.conf
```

### 13. Network Configuration

Set hostname:
```bash
echo "myhostname" > /etc/hostname
```

Edit hosts file:
```bash
nano /etc/hosts
```

Add these lines:
```
127.0.0.1    localhost
::1          localhost
127.0.1.1    myhostname.localdomain    myhostname
```

Enable NetworkManager:
```bash
systemctl enable NetworkManager
```

### 14. Set Root Password

```bash
passwd
```

### 15. Install Boot Loader

#### For UEFI systems:
```bash
pacman -S grub efibootmgr
grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=ARCH
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

#### For BIOS systems:
```bash
pacman -S grub
grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/nvme0n1  # Replace with your disk
grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

### 16. Create a User Account

```bash
useradd -m -G wheel username
passwd username
```

### 17. Set Up Sudo

Install sudo:
```bash
pacman -S sudo
```

Edit sudoers file:
```bash
EDITOR=nano visudo
```

Uncomment the line:
```
%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
```

### 18. Final Steps

Exit the chroot environment:
```bash
exit
```

Unmount all partitions:
```bash
umount -R /mnt
```

Reboot:
```bash
reboot
```

## Post-Installation Steps

After logging into your new Arch system, here are some essential next steps:

### 1. Install a Desktop Environment

#### KDE Plasma:
```bash
sudo pacman -S xorg plasma plasma-wayland-session kde-applications
sudo systemctl enable sddm
sudo systemctl start sddm
```

#### GNOME:
```bash
sudo pacman -S xorg gnome gnome-extra
sudo systemctl enable gdm
sudo systemctl start gdm
```

#### Xfce (lightweight):
```bash
sudo pacman -S xorg xfce4 xfce4-goodies lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter
sudo systemctl enable lightdm
sudo systemctl start lightdm
```

### 2. Install Graphics Drivers

#### NVIDIA:
```bash
sudo pacman -S nvidia nvidia-utils
```

#### AMD:
```bash
sudo pacman -S xf86-video-amdgpu
```

#### Intel:
```bash
sudo pacman -S xf86-video-intel
```

### 3. Install Useful Applications

```bash
sudo pacman -S firefox thunderbird vlc libreoffice-fresh gimp
```

### 4. Set Up AUR Helper

The AUR (Arch User Repository) contains thousands of community-maintained packages. Using an AUR helper simplifies installation:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay-bin.git
cd yay-bin
makepkg -si
```

Now you can install AUR packages:
```bash
yay -S google-chrome visual-studio-code-bin spotify
```

### 5. Enable SSD TRIM (if applicable)

```bash
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
```

### 6. Set Up Firewall

```bash
sudo pacman -S ufw
sudo ufw default deny
sudo ufw allow ssh
sudo ufw enable
sudo systemctl enable ufw
```

### 7. Configure Automatic Updates (Optional)

Install pacman-contrib:
```bash
sudo pacman -S pacman-contrib
```

Create timer files:
```bash
sudo systemctl enable paccache.timer
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### No Internet After Installation

If you can't connect to the internet after installation:
```bash
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager
sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
nmtui  # Connect using text UI
```

### Boot Problems

If the system doesn't boot:
1. Boot from the installation media
2. Mount your partitions (`mount /dev/nvme0n1p3 /mnt`)
3. Chroot into your system (`arch-chroot /mnt`)
4. Reinstall and reconfigure GRUB

### Failed to Start X Server

This is often due to graphics driver issues. Boot into terminal mode and install the correct drivers.

## Advanced Configurations

### Full Disk Encryption

For added security, consider setting up LUKS encryption during installation. This requires additional steps during the partitioning phase.

### Dual-Booting with Windows

When dual-booting with Windows:
1. Install Windows first
2. Install Arch on separate partitions
3. GRUB will detect Windows automatically during `grub-mkconfig`

### ZFS or Btrfs File Systems

For advanced file system features like snapshots, consider using Btrfs instead of ext4:
```bash
mkfs.btrfs /dev/nvme0n1p3
```

### Installing on a Raspberry Pi

Arch Linux ARM provides specific installation instructions for various ARM devices, including Raspberry Pi models.

## Maintaining Your Arch System

### Regular System Updates

Update your system regularly:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu
```

### System Maintenance

Remove orphaned packages:
```bash
sudo pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)
```

Clear the package cache:
```bash
sudo paccache -r
```

### Backup Strategy

Consider setting up automatic backups using tools like:
- Timeshift
- Snapper (for Btrfs)
- Restic
- Borg
