## What Are Containers?

Containers are lightweight, standalone, executable software packages that include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings. Unlike virtual machines, containers share the host system's OS kernel but run in isolated user spaces.

### Containers vs. Virtual Machines

| Containers | Virtual Machines |
|------------|------------------|
| Share host OS kernel | Run complete OS copy |
| Lightweight (MBs) | Heavyweight (GBs) |
| Seconds to start | Minutes to start |
| Less isolated | More isolated |
| Less resource intensive | More resource intensive |

Containers provide a consistent environment across development, testing, and production, eliminating the infamous "it works on my machine" problem that has plagued developers for decades.

## Docker Fundamentals

Docker is the most popular containerization platform that makes it easy to create, deploy, and run applications using containers.

### Core Docker Concepts

- **Docker Engine**: The runtime that enables building and running containers
- **Docker Image**: A read-only template with instructions for creating a container
- **Docker Container**: A runnable instance of an image
- **Docker Registry**: A repository for storing and distributing Docker images
- **Dockerfile**: A text file with instructions to build a Docker image
- **Docker Compose**: A tool for defining and running multi-container applications

### Docker Architecture

Docker uses a client-server architecture:
- **Docker Client**: The primary way users interact with Docker
- **Docker Host**: Runs the Docker daemon (dockerd)
- **Docker Registry**: Stores Docker images (Docker Hub is the public registry)

The flow generally works like this: You use the Docker client to issue commands, the Docker daemon builds, runs, and distributes your containers, and the registry stores your images.

## Key Benefits of Using Docker

1. **Consistency**: The same container runs identically across all environments
2. **Isolation**: Applications and dependencies are packaged together without interference
3. **Portability**: Containers run anywhere Docker is installed
4. **Efficiency**: Containers share OS resources without the overhead of virtual machines
5. **Scalability**: Easily scale applications horizontally by spinning up more containers
6. **Version Control**: Track changes to your container images similar to code
7. **Rapid Deployment**: Start, stop, and restart applications in seconds
8. **Simplified Updates**: Replace existing containers with new ones instead of updating in place

## Setting Up Docker

### Installing Docker

#### For Windows:
1. Download [Docker Desktop for Windows](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Follow the installation wizard
3. Enable WSL 2 feature if prompted

#### For macOS:
1. Download [Docker Desktop for Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
2. Drag Docker to your Applications folder
3. Open Docker (it will ask for privileges)

#### For Linux (Ubuntu):
```bash
# Update package index
sudo apt update

# Install prerequisites
sudo apt install apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl software-properties-common

# Add Docker's official GPG key
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -

# Set up the stable repository
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"

# Install Docker Engine
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

# Add your user to the docker group to avoid using sudo
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### Verifying Installation

After installation, open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
docker --version
docker run hello-world
```

If Docker is properly installed, you'll see the version number and a message from the "hello-world" container.

## Essential Docker Commands

Here are some fundamental Docker commands to get you started:

### Image Commands
- `docker images`: List all local images
- `docker pull <image>`: Download an image from a registry
- `docker rmi <image>`: Remove a local image
- `docker build -t <name:tag> .`: Build an image from a Dockerfile

### Container Commands
- `docker ps`: List running containers
- `docker ps -a`: List all containers (running and stopped)
- `docker run <image>`: Create and start a container
- `docker start <container>`: Start a stopped container
- `docker stop <container>`: Stop a running container
- `docker rm <container>`: Remove a container
- `docker logs <container>`: View container logs
- `docker exec -it <container> <command>`: Run a command inside a running container

### System Commands
- `docker system df`: Show Docker disk usage
- `docker system prune`: Remove unused data (stopped containers, unused networks, dangling images)

## Creating Your First Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a text document containing instructions to build a Docker image. Here's a simple example for a Node.js application:

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js runtime as the base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port the app runs on
EXPOSE 3000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### Dockerfile Instructions Explained

- `FROM`: Specifies the base image to use
- `WORKDIR`: Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions
- `COPY`: Copies files from the host to the container
- `RUN`: Executes commands during image build
- `EXPOSE`: Documents which ports the container listens on
- `CMD`: Defines the default command to run when the container starts

## Building and Running Images

### Building an Image

To build an image from your Dockerfile:

```bash
# Navigate to the directory containing your Dockerfile
cd /path/to/your/app

# Build the image
docker build -t myapp:1.0 .
```

The `-t` flag tags your image with a name and optional version.

### Running a Container

Once you've built your image, you can run it as a container:

```bash
# Basic run
docker run myapp:1.0

# Run in detached mode (background)
docker run -d myapp:1.0

# Map a port from host to container
docker run -p 8080:3000 myapp:1.0

# Mount a volume
docker run -v /host/path:/container/path myapp:1.0

# Set environment variables
docker run -e NODE_ENV=production myapp:1.0

# Name your container
docker run --name my-container myapp:1.0

# Combining options
docker run -d --name my-api -p 8080:3000 -e NODE_ENV=production myapp:1.0
```

## Docker Compose for Multi-Container Applications

Docker Compose simplifies the process of running multi-container applications. It uses a YAML file to define services, networks, and volumes.

### Example `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: ./web
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    depends_on:
      - api
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://api:3000

  api:
    build: ./api
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    depends_on:
      - db
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
      - DB_USER=postgres
      - DB_PASSWORD=secret
      - DB_NAME=mydb

  db:
    image: postgres:14
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
      - POSTGRES_DB=mydb

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

### Running Docker Compose

```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Start in detached mode
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes
docker-compose down -v

# View logs
docker-compose logs

# Scale a specific service
docker-compose up -d --scale api=3
```

## Docker Best Practices

### 1. Use Official Base Images

Starting with official images ensures you're building on secure, well-maintained foundations.

```dockerfile
# Good
FROM node:18-alpine

# Avoid
FROM ubuntu:latest
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y nodejs npm
```

### 2. Minimize Layers

Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a new layer. Combining related commands reduces image size.

```dockerfile
# Good
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y package1 package2 && \
    apt-get clean && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

# Avoid
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y package1
RUN apt-get install -y package2
```

### 3. Use .dockerignore

Create a `.dockerignore` file to exclude files not needed in your image:

```
node_modules
npm-debug.log
.git
.gitignore
.env
*.md
```

### 4. Multi-Stage Builds

Multi-stage builds separate build-time dependencies from runtime dependencies:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18 AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/dist ./dist
COPY --from=build /app/package*.json ./
RUN npm install --production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

### 5. Run as Non-Root User

Running containers as non-root improves security:

```dockerfile
# Create a user
RUN addgroup -S appgroup && adduser -S appuser -G appgroup

# Switch to that user
USER appuser

# Continue with the rest of your Dockerfile
```

### 6. Use Specific Tags

Avoid `latest` tags for production as they can lead to inconsistent builds:

```dockerfile
# Good
FROM node:18.16.0-alpine3.17

# Avoid
FROM node:latest
```

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Container Not Starting

Check the logs:
```bash
docker logs <container-id>
```

### Port Conflicts

If you see an error like "port is already allocated", change the host port:
```bash
docker run -p 8081:3000 myapp:1.0
```

### Container Exiting Immediately

Make sure your application doesn't exit. For debugging, you can:
```bash
docker run -it --entrypoint /bin/sh myapp:1.0
```

### Out of Disk Space

Clear unused Docker resources:
```bash
docker system prune -a
```

### Permission Denied

Check if you need to add your user to the docker group:
```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
# Log out and back in for changes to take effect
```
